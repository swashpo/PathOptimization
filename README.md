# Traveling Salesperson Problem
With n points in a plane, the goal is to calculate the shortest (most efficient) possible traversal of these points. This code contains
two methods: 
1) the nearest neighbor, which reads in points and adds them to the path after the closest point, and
2) smallest increase, which adds the point to the path that results in the smallest increase to the total distance traversed.
